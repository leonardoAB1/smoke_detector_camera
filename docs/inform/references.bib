@inproceedings{Arrivabeni2021,
   abstract = {With the advent of 3D printing, it is now possible to produce any part or system with an approach than makes design much deeply interlaced with production. In this scenario, CAE has gained power thanks to the possibility of thinking and then manufacture ideas that go well beyond what was possible in the past. This design approach is perfectly suitable to push forward mould conformal cooling performance. In this work, a coupling of CAD, CFD and 3D printing supported by experimental tests was applied to define a design procedure for conformal cooling channels. In particular, cooling channels for a mould were engineered via CAD, then tested via CFD and, after an initial optimization procedure, the chosen design was 3D printed in specimens suitable to be mounted on a heat exchanger (HX) experimental test rig that was especially adapted for the scope. Fluids temperature, volume flow rates and heat transfer performance were measured. A feedback loop was considered to link measurements and channels redesign. Results together with design and testing procedures are reported and commented.},

@review{Shinde2017,
   abstract = {This article aims to provide an overview of applications of rapid prototyping-assisted conformal cooling channel and shows the potential of this technology in different manufacturing processes. This review article also reports one case study from open literature where rapid prototyping-assisted conformal cooling channel has been successfully used in the manufacturing process. This study concludes that rapid prototyping technique can replace conventional manufacturing for complicated structure conformal cooling channel which improves quality and productivity. The outcome based on literature review and case study strongly suggested that rapid prototyping-assisted conformal cooling channel might become standard procedure in manufacturing process in near future. Advanced technologies such as computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering, computer fluid dynamics, and rapid tooling made it possible to fabricate the conformal cooling channel. Rapid prototyping-assisted conformal cooling channel can easily transfer the simulation into actual fabrication. This article is beneficial to study the development and application of rapid prototyping-assisted conformal cooling channel in different manufacturing processes.},
