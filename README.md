# IoT Project Directory Structure

This repository contains the directory structure for an IoT project. The structure is designed to organize the different components of the project and provide a logical arrangement for source code, documentation, configuration files, and more.

## Directory Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- **/docs**: Contains project documentation files, including system architecture, API documentation, and user manuals.

- **/src**: Holds the source code files for different components of the IoT system.
  - **/device**: Contains device-specific code, firmware, or software that runs on the IoT devices/sensors.
  - **/gateway**: Includes code related to the gateway or edge computing component of the IoT project.
  - **/cloud**: Contains code related to the cloud or backend infrastructure, including data processing, storage, and API endpoints.

- **/config**: Contains configuration files for different components or modules within the project.

- **/tests**: Includes test files for unit tests, integration tests, or any other test-related files.

- **/data**: Contains data files required for the project, such as sample datasets.

- **/deploy**: Holds deployment-related files, such as deployment scripts or configuration files.

- **/scripts**: Contains utility scripts that assist in development, automation, or deployment tasks.

- **/logs**: Holds log files generated by the application or system.
